Vidi supports fundamental data types, arrays, functions, and command line arguments.

The reason this has not been done is because the previous interpreter for the language was written in OCaml. The new interpreter is being developed in C++. The change was made because C++ is used more frequently than OCaml, so it should be more possible for relatively inexperienced programmers to contribute to the language. The plan is for Vidi to go open source after such an interpreter is implemented.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\tAside from that, some general goals of the language are to ship with a debugger, as well as include support for creating advanced and linked data structures.\n    </p>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default IndexPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
