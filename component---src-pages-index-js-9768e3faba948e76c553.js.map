The reason this has not been done is because the sole interpreter for the language is written in OCaml. Since the language's targeted audience is novice programmers, it would be preferable for the interpreter to written in a more common language, so that even relatively inexperienced programmers could contribute to the language. The plan is for Vidi to go open source after such an interpreter is implemented.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\tAside from that, some general goals of the language are to ship with a debugger, as well as include support for creating advanced and linked data structures.\n    </p>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default IndexPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
