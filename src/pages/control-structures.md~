In Vidi, the fundamental control structures are `IF` statements and `WHILE` statements. These control structures function in Vidi similarly to how they function in most languages.

### If Statements

An `IF`statement is written using `IF ... THEN ... ENDIF` wherein the `IF` is succeeded by an expression that evaluates to a boolean. The `THEN` is succeeded by a statement or series of statements that are evaluated if the expression evaluates to `TRUE`. Optionally, `ENDIF` can be prepended by `ELSE ...`, `ELSE` is succeeded by a statement or series of statements which are evaluated if the expression evaluates to `FALSE`.
