Strings in Vidi are currently very basic. Although it is intended for the characters of a string to be accessible as if the string were an array, this has not yet been implemented.

Strings in Vidi are sequences of chracters between double qoutes: `"..."`. Currently, strings have the following functionality.

| Operation | Description |
| :------: | ----------- |
| `PRINT A` | Prints the string A |
| `A + B` | Concatenates strings A and B |
| `A * I` | Repeats string A I times |
